Name Space Notes

Creating folders - 
    *  way of organization for classes
    *  another level of accessibility
    *  think of as 1:1 equivalent to the folder you are working in
    *  nameSpace - when code compiles it takes all things in same name space and creates an assembly
        assembly - part of dll file -> physical manifest compiled version of what is in the same folder



    Inside project create folder
