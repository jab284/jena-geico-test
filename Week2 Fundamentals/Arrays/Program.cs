//Arrays
/*
    Problem:  There is a lot of DATA that exists!!
    Managing each piece in its own variable is going to become impractical
    A lot is quite similar or related whether its by purpose or even Data type.

    We need to inroduce a means to store multiple pieces of data within one device/var

    Arrays -> offers a way for us to very simply store multiple values of the same 

    Syntax:

    DataType[] variableName = new DataType[size];    // create an array of a certain size
*/

//Basic example:
    int[] numbers = new int[5];  //Not an int - its an array that holds an int - and holds 5
