Lambda expressions

reversed operation - (normal num*7 = num)

- num => num * 7 ---> given an input 'num' perform num * 7

num is a placeholder name for "whatever input is received"


public static void AddTwoNumbers(int num1, int num2)
{
	return num1 + num2;
}

AddTwoNumbers(5, 7);

- When are Lambda Expressions going to be used?

- Often times methods are already built to take in Lambdas as an easier way to 
	essentially pass in functionality into another method.

- This will happen often when working with sets/collections of data.
There are often several methods that will perform an operation over every value (like a loop).

- LINQ -> Language Integrated Query -> used for simplifying querying or manipulating collections.
	- It offers some methods for performing operations on our collections that feel more like SQL Querying.

SELECT * FROM User WHERE Id = 5;
	- LINQ: filteredMovies = allMovies.Where(x => x.Price <5);   //Lambda feeds function into function

	Console.WriteLine(AddTwoNumbers(5, 7));
